    <p><i>It probably isn't any surprise that Fleabag herself is the most hysterical character. From breaking the fourth wall to her sarcastic side comments to saying just about anything on her mind, Fleabag is as awkward and cringy as she is totally funny.

Fans will never forget her confession at the circle or her worst moments with her Godmother or the Bank Manager. Fleabag is just funny in her nature, and while she might actually be the only character that tries to be, it certainly works.
It isn't just Fleabag who has fallen head over heels for the Priest. He's not only handsome, but he's intelligent, fun, kind, and absolutely hilarious. He's quick-witted, and totally confident in throwing out some sarcasm and quips.

From his obsession with the Priest's clothing to his banter with Fleabag, the Priest is beyond easy to laugh with - and at. It's no doubt he's one of the funniest characters the series has to offer.</i>

        <h2>Roger Ebert</h2>
        <p>That’s true of the series as a whole. Too often you watch a television show and wonder what could have been excised; here, not a beat is spared. Yet when it reaches its bittersweet, indelible conclusion, the ache isn’t one of wishing “Fleabag” could go on forever. It’s a simple, sweet moment of loss. Waller-Bridge makes the camera Fleabag’s confidant; it’s a relationship that’s not in the least one-sided. When her sidelong glances end, you might long for the connection to continue—but when you love something, you open yourself up to loss. As with all the great loves one encounters in life, this one is worth the heartache.</p>
